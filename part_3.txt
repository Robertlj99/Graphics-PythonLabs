I really liked this example because of the realistic water. I love the ocean and it immediately drew my eyes. My brain immediately either goes to outer space or the ocean when coming up with scene ideas so this one grabbed me immediately. I could not find the source code for this example, to be honest just having it open in my browser greatly slowed down my old laptop. I would be very interested to see how exactly they coded the water. This class has turned my oppinion around on graphics greatly so I think you did a great job introducing and explaining the concepts especially the scary linear algebra matrix multiplication stuff that I hated previously. I'm not to sure my laptop could handle more than the minecraft cubes and ray tracer but getting to code visuals such as the one I linked would be cool if the technical limitations werent there.
